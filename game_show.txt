# Monty Hall Problem

# There are 3 doors behind which are two goats and a car
# You pick a door, hoping to choose a car
# The game show host, examines the other doors and opens one with a goat (if both doors have goats, he picks randomly)

PLAN

# We're going to make 3 variables that represent doors and these doors will randomly choose which doors will have a goat or a car

# ex 

list_of_doors = ['door_a', 'door_b', 'door_c']
shuffle(list_of_doors)
